# GitHub Basics

These are your instructions for getting started with GitHub.

To learn why GitHub is important, you can read:

* [What Exactly Is GitHub Anyway?](https://techcrunch.com/2012/07/14/what-exactly-is-github-anyway/) (2012)
* [How GitHub Conquered Google, Microsoft, and Everyone Else](http://www.wired.com/2015/03/github-conquered-google-microsoft-everyone-else/) (2015)
* [GitHub Is Microsoft’s $7.5 Billion Undo Button](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-06-06/github-is-microsoft-s-7-5-billion-undo-button) (2018)

If you're not interested in why GitHub is important, then don't read them.

## What is a repo?

Right now you’re looking at a GitHub repo. “Repo” is short for “repository.” A repo is a place to store code. More important, it is a place to keep a record of all your changes. It’s also great for sharing and collaborating.

This repo is named “CSS-and-GitHub-intro.” The name of any repo is at the top of the web page.

A repo usually contains several folders and files. Some repos contain dozens of folders and files — maybe even hundreds.

## Sign up for GitHub

So you can play too, you need to get a GitHub account (if you don’t have one yet). There should be a “Sign Up” link or button in the top right corner of this page (if you are not already signed in).

If you already have a GitHub account, use that one.

**Note:** Think about your username before you choose it. This is a professional space. Your username will be visible to strangers. Many people use their real first and last names. A short username is good.

GitHub is free unless you want some [special features](https://github.com/pricing) for collaboration. You will not need those for this class.

You can have only ONE GitHub account per email address.

A repo can be public or private. Your work for this course will all be public.

## Download the GitHub Desktop app

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Also free. If you downloaded this app before now, check to make sure you have the *newest* version.

*On the GitHub Desktop menu (Mac) or the File menu (Windows), open “About GitHub Desktop” to check that you’ve got the latest version.*

I will refer to GitHub Desktop as “the app.”

Install the app. To see how, go to [Installing and configuring GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop).

**IMPORTANT:** Using the same instructions as needed, LINK your GitHub account to the app. This is called “Authenticating to GitHub.” **Note:** You do NOT have 2FA or Enterprise.

You DID sign up for GitHub already — yes? This only works if you have a GitHub account.

**Windows users:** When they show something on the "GitHub Desktop" menu, for you it will be on the File menu for the app.

## Get organized

Time for some thinking: GitHub expects things to be stable on your hard drive(s). That means you need to decide very deliberately WHERE on your hard drive a folder associated with GitHub will be. DO NOT associate GitHub with folders on your Desktop! Folders for your web projects should always be inside your Documents folder on your hard drive.

Go *inside* your Documents folder and make a **new folder** there. This ONE folder will contain all other folders that you will associate with GitHub. You might name that folder Webwork, or Datawork, or Code, or some other general term. Name it something that makes sense to you. (I think it would be confusing to name it GitHub. Maybe naming it GitHub_Projects would be okay.)

**NO SPACES in FOLDER NAMES for online projects.**

Alternatively, you could make this folder *inside* the folder you already have for this class. There’s no problem with that.

Your GitHub app is going to coordinate things for you between the web (GitHub) and your hard drive — but GitHub can’t think, and GitHub can’t figure out that you have moved a folder or changed its name. So plan ahead, and make a folder that will STAY PUT and KEEP THE SAME NAME.

## Next steps

To get you started, we will **fork** and then **clone** a repo. (Those GitHub words will all be defined as we go along.)

**Go back to the top of this repo now,** and you’ll learn how.

**To get back to the top of any repo,** find the link with **the repo’s name** in the top left area of the web page (the page you are reading right now). Click the link!

Go to the top of this page now, find that link, and go back to where you started. Find this subheading there: “Forking a repo.”
